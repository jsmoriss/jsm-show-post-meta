Show all post meta (aka custom fields) in a metabox on post editing pages. 

== Description ==

Show all post meta (aka custom fields) keys and their unserialized values in a metabox on the bottom of post editing pages.

This plugin is useful in cases where:

<ul>
<li>You're wondering what post meta your theme and/or plugins might be creating.</li>
<li>You need to find the name of a specific post meta key.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
The original plugin code is from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-meta-inspector/">Post Meta Inspector"</a> plugin by Daniel Bachhuber and Automattic. Improvements include better CSS for display boundaries, unserializing array values, and arrays shown as preformatted text.
